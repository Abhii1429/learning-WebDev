    <h2>About DOM</h2>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is the foundation of <em>Extensible Markup Language</em>, or XML. XML documents have a hierarchy of <del>informational units </del>called nodes; DOM is a way of <strong>describing those nodes and the relationships</strong> between them.
    DOM Document is a collection of <b>nodes</b>, or pieces of information, organized in a hierarchy. 
    This hierarchy allows a developer to navigate around the tree looking for specific information. Because it is based on a hierarchy of information, the DOM is said to be tree based.
